        <p>Here I'm, it's 2020, we are in the middle of a plague and I'm learning PHP.</p>
        <p>
            I live in a loop of choosing a technology, learning it, regret the choice and start over. 
            I'm tired of it, I need to get my projects done and get out of this infinite cycle that is driving me mad. 
            So I stopped everything and started thinking on how to make a choice and stick to it, 
            influenced by <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology" target="_blank">this essay</a> 
            I decided to choose a boring technology, but wich one? There are so many options in the market.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did some research and listed some mainstream languages/frameworks like Java/Spring, C#/.NET Core, Python/Django, 
            Ruby/Rails, PHP/Laravel, next I started removing some options that I dont like so much, 3 options remained in the list, 
            the next factor of decision was choosing something with the less fraction to start learning and that I feel comfortable with, 
            I ended up with two options, Python and PHP, next factor was "if things get ugly can I make money with it?", both languages 
            have a huge usage in the market and a lot of opportunities, so both stayed in the game. At this point the nostalgic feeling 
            was a important factor. The first web language that I learned was PHP, in that time the experience was magical, a new world of 
            possibilities have oppened for me. I liked so much the experience. Perhaps this feeling will came back? Well, I don't know, 
            things change right? Let's check what changed, PHP 7? Cool, Laravel? Cool, this modern PHP thing sounds good, how can I learn it? 
            Hum, we have Laracasts and they seem nice. I'm In!
        </p>
        <p>
            You know, I don't give a shit about the current criticism and jokes on PHP, I also laugh at the jokes. The only thing that I need is a reliable stack to 
            create my projects, something that just works and dont give me headaches, my focus need to be in creating a good product and in my clients, 
            the things behind the scenes just need to be working and don't crashing for no reason, i'm a fan of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" target="_blank">KISS principle</a> 
            and I try to follow it in most things that I do, that's why i'm back in the LAMP stack.
        </p>
        <p>
            An important point is that I will not stop learning new things, if I discover some new interesting technology I will learn it just for shits and giggles. 
            Mess with technology without worry is very fun, and I recommend it to everyone.
        </p>
        <p>PHP is not dead and will not die. I think that PHP is a zombie.</p>
